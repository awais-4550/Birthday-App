# How to Deploy Your Birthday Website

Since your website is built with simple HTML, CSS, and JS, you can host it for free very easily. Here are the two best methods:

## Method 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
*Best for getting a link immediately without installing anything.*

1. **Locate your folder**: Open your Finder to `/Users/awais/Downloads/`.
2. **Open Netlify Drop**: Go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) in your browser.
3. **Drag and Drop**: Drag the entire `happy-birthday-master` folder onto the webpage.
4. **Get Link**: Netlify will instantly upload it and give you a unique link (e.g., `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`).
5. **Rename (Optional)**: If you sign up for a free Netlify account, you can change the site name to something like `https://manos-birthday-surprise.netlify.app`.

## Method 2: GitHub Pages (Permanent)
*Best if you have a GitHub account and want it to last forever.*

1. **Create a Repository**: Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository (name it `birthday-wish`).
2. **Upload Files**: If you are not comfortable with the command line:
   - Open your new repository on GitHub.
   - Click "Add file" > "Upload files".
   - Drag all files from your `happy-birthday-master` folder into the browser window.
   - Click "Commit changes".
3. **Enable Pages**:
   - Go to the repository **Settings**.
   - Click on **Pages** in the left sidebar.
   - Under "Source", select **main** branch and click **Save**.
   - GitHub will generate a link for you (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/birthday-wish/`).

## Important Note on Music
Since modern browsers block "Auto-play" audio, the user **must interact** with the page (click somewhere) before music starts.
- This is why the **"Start" button** on the first screen is perfect. The music will play as soon as they click it.
